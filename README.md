# ARM-RTC

In this project with the help of STM32 Smart v2.0 (which is based on stm32f103c8t6 microcontroller) and an LCD, a clock and a calender are built.The project uses the concept of internal RTC of the microcontroller to create real time that we can display on LCD along with the date.
This ARM program was built with Keil and STM32Cube.
Note:Due to the limitations,not all the files for the project are brought here.If you're interested in the whole project you can contact me and I'll send it to you.
